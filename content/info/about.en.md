We are a small group of people working at different tech companies from Madrid. We created MadAi independently to share knowledge and experiences around AI engineering applied to production and integrating AI into our development processes.

Some of the topics we usually discuss: **context engineering**, **RAG**, **AI governance and observability**, **AI in the development flow**, **model evaluation processes**, **agent development and operations**...

If you are interested in giving a talk on any of these topics, [get in touch with us](mailto:madai.techcommunity@gmail.com) and if you are curious, we would love to see you at one of our events — check our [calendar on Lu.ma](https://luma.com/madai).
