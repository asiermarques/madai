#### Manifesto

**We are an independent community; we do not sell anything**  
At our events, we do not sell products from any company. Our goal is to share and learn. We prefer to host fewer events if that helps ensure the quality of the talks and uphold this principle.

**We are English-friendly**  
If even one person at a meetup doesn't speak Spanish, we all switch to English to include them.  
We never criticize anyone's level of English.

**Respect is not optional**  
We aim to ensure a safe space that encourages participation. All contributions are respected, regardless of experience or any other factor.  
We are aligned with and follow the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/en)
